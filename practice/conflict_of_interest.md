# Conflict of interest

I do not have any dealings with drug companies. I do not talk with drug company representatives. I do not accept anything from them such as samples or honorariae. None of my research is supported by drug companies.

I do not treat people with whom I have some other relationship such as friends or students of mine. I do not socialize with my patients.
