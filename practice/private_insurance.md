# Private insurance

There are two major types of insurance: Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO's) and Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO's). If you have HMO coverage, you must get mental health services from them.
If you have a PPO, you will probably get some reimbursement if you see me.

I do not bill insurance companies for you. I supply a receipt for you to submit to your insurance company. Almost all my patients have insurance and most get reimbursed by their insurance company. I have a small practice, and I keep my overhead (and my fees) down by not hiring a person to waste time dunning insurance companies. Your insurance policy is a contract between you and your insurance company, **not** between me and your insurance company. You are ultimately responsible for paying for your care.

Many people need me to fill out the State of Maryland Uniform Treatment Plans (UTPs). Under [[forms|forms]], I have partially filled out UTP forms for you to download. Please fill in the top part of the form above the line that starts "Have you communicated with the PCP..." bring it with you and let me know at the beginning of your session so that I have time to complete it. 

I would urge you to keep copies of any documents that you send to insurance companies to save your time and mine and to avoid additional [[paperwork|paperwork fees]].
