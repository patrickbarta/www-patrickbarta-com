## Initial consultation
I want to talk with prospective patients before I make an appointment to see them so I'm certain I feel I can be helpful.

I will talk with anyone about making an initial appointment, but I will insist on speaking to the patient before I will see him or her. Anyone unwilling to speak with me first is unlikely to show.

If you want to come for a consultation,leave a message on my answering machine or send me an email with your phone number.

If you come for a consultation, please follow the [first visit](policies/firstVisit.md) instructions **before you arrive**. If you follow these instructions, you will get a more thorough consultation.
