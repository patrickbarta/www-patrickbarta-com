## Initial consultation
I want to talk with prospective patients before I make an appointment to see them so I'm certain I feel I can be helpful.

I will talk with anyone about making an initial appointment, but I will insist on talking with the patient before I will see him or her. Anyone unwilling to speak with me first is unlikely to show.

If you want to come for a consultation,leave a message on my answering machine or drop me an email with your phone number.

If you come for a consultation, please read the [first visit](policies/firstVisit.md) page before you come. 

If you do the things on that page before you come, it frees up at least 20  minutes during your consultation. During the extra time, we can discuss why you came and what to do rather than spending the time doing paperwork.
