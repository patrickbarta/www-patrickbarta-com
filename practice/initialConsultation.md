If you would like, you may leave a message on my answering machine, or drop me an email with your contact information.



If you do come for a consultation, I would appreciate it if you would look over the [[first_visit|first visit page]] before you come. If you can do the things on that page before you come, it will free up at least 20 more minutes during your consultation during which we can discuss why you came and what to do rather than spending the time doing
paperwork.
