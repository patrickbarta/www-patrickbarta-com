##Appointments
I would prefer to talk with you on the phone before your first appointment, primarily to make sure that I feel that I may be able to help you. 

If you would like, you may leave a message on my answering machine, or drop me an email with your contact information.

In general, I try to avoid having someone other than the patient be involved in setting the first appointment time, unless the patient is a minor.

If you do come for a consultation, I would appreciate it if you would look over the [[first_visit|first visit page]] before you come. If you can do the things on that page before you come, it will free up at least 20 additional minutes
during your consultation during which we can discuss why you came and what to do rather than spending the time doing
paperwork.
